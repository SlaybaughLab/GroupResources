# GroupResources
A common place to compile resources of use to the research group

[General Resources](./general-resources/) is a folder that contains general
resource information on tools and software that the group uses frequently. This
includes LaTeX, primers for software packages, information on using Savio, our
HPC system at UC Berkeley, and best practices in software development. 

[Paperwork](./paperwork/) is a folder with pertinent paperwork that you will
need to complete to fulfill various requirements for your academic pathway,
whether that be your Master's, PhD, Postdoc, or Staff Position. This includes information about conference travel and reimbursement.

[Reproducibility](./reproducibility/) contains information about best practices
to conduct computational science responsibly and reproducibly. This research
group is committed to following these principles to the best of our ability.

[Templates](./templates/) is a folder containing templates for conference
papers, theses, posters, and whatever else. It's a menagerie of template types
and files!  

[I,Librarian](./ilibrarian/) contains information about the group's shared reference
manager/repository. Currently it has the presentation used to guide the training
given on 08/24/16; full guidelines and a tutorial will follow soon.
