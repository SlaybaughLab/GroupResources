# Course Selection

Here are some courses that could be useful for you all to take, separated by
category.

## Applied Math (Math)

### Definitely Useful
- **221: Advanced Matrix Computations**

- **224B: Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences**  
The course will survey basic theory and practical methods for solving the fundamental problems of mathematical physics.
It is intended for graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, engineering or other mathematical
sciences.
The overall purpose of the course will be to develop non-numerical tools for understanding and approximating solutions of differential equations.

+ **E 231: Mathematical Methods in Engineering**  
This course offers an integrated treatment of three topics essential to modern engineering: linear algebra, random processes, and optimization.
These topics will be covered more rapidly than in separate undergraduate courses covering the same material, and will draw on engineering examples for motivation.
The stress will be on proofs and computational aspects will also be highlighted. 
It is intended for engineering students whose research focus has a significant mathematical component, but who have not previously had a thorough exposure 
to these topics.*

***Note:** Good class for graduate student who hasn't had exposure to linear algebra, statistics, and optimization in the past.
This is probably not very useful for people who have already taken lots of linear algebra, statistics, or optimization courses.

- **273: Advanced Topics in Nuclear Methods**  

- **275: Topics in Applied Mathematics**  
Advanced topics chosen by the instructor.
The content of this course changes, as in the case of seminars.

this course, since there is a fair amount of overlap, with the graduate course
focusing more on understanding the method and the undergraduate course more on
using FEM software (COMSOL) for a larger variety of applications.
