# Course Selection

Here are some courses that could be useful for you all to take, separated by
category.

## Applied Math (Math)

### Definitely Useful
+ 221: Advanced Matrix Computations
 Direct solution of linear systems, including large sparse systems: error
bounds, iteration methods, least square approximation, eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of matrices, nonlinear equations, and minimization of functions.

+ 228A: Numerical Solution of Differential Equations

equations; Boundary value problem; Eigenvalue problem; Discretization

entirely FEM, FVM, and DG.

fundamental problems of mathematical physics. It is intended for graduate
students in applied mathematics, physics, engineering or other mathematical
sciences. The overall purpose of the course will be to develop non-numerical
tools for understanding and approximating solutions of differential equations.

+ E 231: Mathematical Methods in Engineering
This course offers an integrated treatment of three topics essential to modern
engineering: linear algebra, random processes, and optimization. These topics 
will be covered more rapidly than in separate undergraduate courses covering
the same material, and will draw on engineering examples for motivation.
The stress will be on proofs and computational aspects will also be highlighted. 
It is intended for engineering students whose research focus has a significant 
mathematical component, but who have not previously had a thorough exposure 
to these topics. (F)

**Note:** Good class for graduate student who hasn't had exposure to linear
algebra, statistics, and optimization in the past. This is probably not very 
useful for people who have already taken lots of linear algebra, statistics, 
or optimization courses.

- 273: Advanced Topics in Nuclear Methods

- 275: Topics in Applied Mathematics
Advanced topics chosen by the instructor. The content of this course changes, as
in the case of seminars.
