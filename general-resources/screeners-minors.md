# Screeners

UCB Nuclear Engineering offers 7 possible screening exams for PhD students. (each screening exam roughly corresponds to one upper-division undergratduate course, listed in parentheses):

1. Nuclear physics (NE 101)
1. Radiation detection (NE 104)
1. Nuclear materials (NE 120)
1. Nuclear waste management(NE 124)
1. **Neutronics (NE 150)**
1. Fusion (NE 180)
1. Heat transfer and fluid mechanics

Students must pass 4 screening exams in their first year.  Most students in our group take neutronics and then 3 other screeners based on their unique projects and interests. 


# Minors

PhD students are required to have 2 minors, one of which must be primarily focused outside of the department. 

Students will often choose one minor to be related to radiation transport (e.g. including NE 150, NE 155, NE 250, or NE 255).
Previous students have often chosen the other outside minor to be related to their specific research projects. Examples could be "numerical methods and applied mathematics", "computer science and computer architecture", or "statistics and data science".

Full major/minor requirements can be found on the [relevant section of the department website](https://nuc.berkeley.edu/doctoral-ph-d-program/) or in the [Graduate Handbook (_password protected_)](http://coenuc.wpengine.com/ne-grad-handbook/). 


In addition to the minors, students have often pursued the Designated Emphasis in Computational and Data Science and Engineering ([DE-CDSE](http://citris-uc.org/decse-mission/)).
Rachel is one of the DE-CDSE faculty, so can serve as the member of your committee satisfying that requirement.
