#LaTeX Resources

This is a list of LaTeX resources. For templates, see the Templates section.

##Installation 

* For Windows, use the [MiKTeK installation](http://www.miktex.org/ "windows installation").
* For Mac, use the [MacTeX installation](https://tug.org/mactex/ "mac installation").
* For Linux, use the [TeX Live installation](http://www.tug.org/texlive/ "linux installation").

##For Beginners

* If you are an _absolute beginner_, I recommend starting with [LaTeX Basics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics "latex basics") on wikibooks.
* Cornell has great tutorials for beginners [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Misc/LaTeX-Tutorial/LaTeX-Home.html "cornell tutorials").
* Trinity College has a nice online guide [here](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/ "trinity guide").
* The comprehensive [LaTeX symbol list (in pdf)](http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf "symbol list") contains (nearly) every known symbol in LaTeX format.
* The AMS website has a _Short Math Guide_ for LaTeX [here](http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/amslatex "ams TeX resources"), as well as other useful resources. The _Short Math Guide_ is a concise summary of the essential features in LaTeX for writing math formulas, including features provided by the packages amssymb and amsmath.
* The short course _LaTeX: Math into LaTeX Short Course_ can be downloaded [here (in pdf)](http://tex.loria.fr/general/mil.pdf "short course"). It is based on the book _Math into LaTeX - An Introduction to LaTeX and AMS-LaTeX_ by George Gratzer, published by Birkhauser Boston, ISBN 0-8176-3805-9.

##Editors

All editors below are open-source and multi-platform. 

* The most popular and user-friendly TeX editor is [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ "texmaker").
* [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/ "texstudio") is another good LaTeX editor. It is pretty much an extension of TeXmaker.
* If you prefer a GUI-based approach to LaTeX, then [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/ "texworks") is your best bet. It features a built-in PDF viewer like TeXmaker and TeXstudio, but this tool also possesses an auto-synchronisation feature to it.
* If you don't want to install anything, then try [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/ "Overleaf") (including what was formerly [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/ "ShareLatex")). Dropbox and GitHub syncing supported, 400+ ready-to-use templates, no installations needed. It also allows direct collaboration for a fee.

##Editing for Papers

It is highly recommended to write papers in LaTeX and host it on GitHub. We can
then read and edit one anothers papers and submit changes as pull requests.
GitHub facilitates looking at differences, but another tool to help with that is
[latexdiff](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff?lang=en). It will take two files
and generate a new one that shows the differences, track-changes style. Some
journals request this kind of markup for responding to reviewer changes--this is
a quick way to do it.

**Pro Tip:** write your papers with either fixed line length or with each
sentence as its own line. This makes it way easier to see the changes (if you
only put a new paragraph as a new line it's hard to tell what is different).


##Presentations, Slides, Posters

* For **slides and presentations** you should _really_ consider the Beamer package (available [here](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer "beamer") from CTAN). A full copy of the beamer userguide is [here (in pdf)](http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf "beamer userguide").
* A good startpoint for Beamer newbies is this [wikibooks entry](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations "wikibooks beamer").
* The _Research Science Institute_ has a nice Beamer tutorial [here (in pdf)](http://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/beamer-tutorial.pdf "beamer tutorial").
* And [here](https://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/ "beamer themes") you'll find a matrix of Beamer themes to choose from.
* If you want to be fancy, you can use the [Fancyslides class](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/fancyslides-presentation "fancyslides"), which builds on top of the Beamer class to give it a modern and concise design. 
* For **posters** that look great and are easy to make, use the [tikzposter package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tikzposter "tikzposter"). It uses TikZ for generating posters; several formatting options are available, and spacing and layout of the poster is to a large extent automated.
* A nice tutorial poster for the tikzposter package can be found [here (in pdf)](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/53332341910d975953dffdab/v/1/pdf?inline=true&name=Tikzposter%20(extended%20example) "tikzposter example").

##Other Useful Links

* The [LaTeX project](https://latex-project.org/ "latex project") website is the official LaTeX website.
* The comprehensive TeX archive network - [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/ "ctan") is the central place for all kinds of material around TeX. Most of the packages are free and can be downloaded and used immediately.
* A collection of useful [LaTeX tips](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/tips.html "latex tips") compiled by A.J. Hildebrand at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
* If you get stuck, you may find answers on the [TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/ "tex latex exchange"). It is a question and answer site for users of TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt, and related typesetting systems. It's 100% free, no registration required.
