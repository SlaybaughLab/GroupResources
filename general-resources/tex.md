#LaTeX Resources

This is a list of LaTeX resources. For templates, see the Templates section.

##Installation 

* For Windows, use the [MiKTeK installation](http://www.miktex.org/ "windows installation").
* For Mac, use the [MacTeX installation](https://tug.org/mactex/ "mac installation").
* For Linux, use the [TeX Live installation](http://www.tug.org/texlive/ "linux installation").

##For Beginners

* If you are an _absolute beginner_, I recommend starting with [LaTeX Basics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics "latex basics") on wikibooks.
* Cornell has great tutorials for beginners [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Misc/LaTeX-Tutorial/LaTeX-Home.html "cornell tutorials").
* Trinity College has a nice online guide [here](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/ "trinity guide").
* The comprehensive [LaTeX symbol list (in pdf)](http://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf "symbol list") contains (nearly) every known symbol in LaTeX format.
* The AMS website has a _Short Math Guide_ for LaTeX [here](http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/amslatex "ams TeX resources"), as well as other useful resources. The _Short Math Guide_ is a concise summary of the essential features in LaTeX for writing math formulas, including features provided by the packages amssymb and amsmath.
* The short course _LaTeX: Math into LaTeX Short Course_ can be downloaded [here (in pdf)](http://tex.loria.fr/general/mil.pdf "short course"). It is based on the book _Math into LaTeX - An Introduction to LaTeX and AMS-LaTeX_ by George Gratzer, published by Birkhauser Boston, ISBN 0-8176-3805-9.

##Editors

All editors below are open-source and multi-platform. 

* The most popular and user-friendly TeX editor is [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ "texmaker").
* [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/ "texstudio") is another good LaTeX editor. It is pretty much an extension of TeXmaker.
* If you prefer a GUI-based approach to LaTeX, then [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/ "texworks") is your best bet. It features a built-in PDF viewer like TeXmaker and TeXstudio, but this tool also possesses an auto-synchronisation feature to it.
* If you don't want to install anything, then try [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/ "sharelatex"). Dropbox and GitHub syncing supported, 400+ ready-to-use templates, no installations needed. It also allows direct collaboration for a fee.

##Presentations, Slides, Posters

* For **slides and presentations** you should _really_ consider the Beamer package (available [here](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer "beamer") from CTAN). A full copy of the beamer userguide is [here (in pdf)](http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf "beamer userguide").
* A good startpoint for Beamer newbies is this [wikibooks entry](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations "wikibooks beamer").
* The _Research Science Institute_ has a nice Beamer tutorial [here (in pdf)](http://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/beamer-tutorial.pdf "beamer tutorial").
* And [here](https://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/ "beamer themes") you'll find a matrix of Beamer themes to choose from.
* If you want to be fancy, you can use the [Fancyslides class](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/fancyslides-presentation "fancyslides"), which builds on top of the Beamer class to give it a modern and concise design. 
* For **posters** that look great and are easy to make, use the [tikzposter package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tikzposter "tikzposter"). It uses TikZ for generating posters; several formatting options are available, and spacing and layout of the poster is to a large extent automated.
* A nice tutorial poster for the tikzposter package can be found [here (in pdf)](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/53332341910d975953dffdab/v/1/pdf?inline=true&name=Tikzposter%20(extended%20example) "tikzposter example").

##Other Useful Links

* The [LaTeX project](https://latex-project.org/ "latex project") website is the official LaTeX website.
* The comprehensive TeX archive network - [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/ "ctan") is the central place for all kinds of material around TeX. Most of the packages are free and can be downloaded and used immediately.
* A collection of useful [LaTeX tips](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/tips.html "latex tips") compiled by A.J. Hildebrand at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
* If you get stuck, you may find answers on the [TeX - LaTeX Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/ "tex latex exchange"). It is a question and answer site for users of TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt, and related typesetting systems. It's 100% free, no registration required.
