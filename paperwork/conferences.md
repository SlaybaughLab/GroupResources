## Conference Travel booking and reimbursement

Probably the best way is to follow the Cal directions
[here](http://travel.berkeley.edu/book-trip). What is below is at least some of what works beyond that; it might not be the most efficient. 

For most items below, you can either purchase it and be reimbursed, or we can follow a procedure such that it can be paid for ahead of time.

#### Flights
1. Fill out a [direct bill id request form](./DirectBillIDRequestForm.pdf) and send to Professor Slaybaugh
1.  Choose a flight and send details to Professor Slaybaugh
1. Professor Slaybaugh will get your flight through the UC system

Alternative: purchase yourself and get reimbursed

#### Registration
1. Fill out the conference registration form and take a screenshot of each filled-out page (if applicable). _Do not actually register._
1. Send these to Professor Slaybaugh
1. A grants officer will register on your behalf

Alternative: purchase yourself and get reimbursed

#### Other Transportation/Food/Lodging
- Save all transportation, food, and lodging reciepts
- File using the ERSO reimbursement form afterwards

Once you've completed the trip, collect pertinent information and follow the
[reimbursement](./reimbursements.md) directions.
