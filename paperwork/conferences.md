## Conference Travel Grant

The Graduate Division offers a travel grant for graduate students who are presenting at research conferences. 
Full details regarding eligibility are given on the [Graduate Division website](https://grad.berkeley.edu/resource/conference-travel-grants/).
The application for the grants is through the ['gradapp' web portal](https://gradapp.berkeley.edu/manage/login?realm=&r=https://gradapp.berkeley.edu/apply/?pk=FWS)

## Conference Travel Booking and Reimbursement

Conference registration and travel can be booked in advance by a grant officer or member of the ERSO team. 
They will charge the project account directly, and you will not need to pay out of pocket.
Other conference expenses (e.g. food, lodging, and local transportation) must be reimbursed.
